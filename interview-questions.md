# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git hub is a platform for software developers to express code. git is the pltform itself?

Researched answer: GitHub is a web-based version control and collaboration platform for software developers.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer:  ||

Researched answer: The logical OR ( || ) (logical disjunction) operator for a set of operands is true if and only if one or more of its operands is true

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: its index is the number of containers it holds and its value is

Researched answer: An array is an object that stores many values of the same type. An array element is one value in an array. An array index is an integer indicating a position in an array

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: they're the same because they count the elements in the fumction but they are different because one starts count at 0 and the other starts count at 1

Researched answer: the main difference between the two is that arrays can have any data type of any length while strings are usually ASCII characters that are terminated with a null character ‘\0’. Both are very different in terms of how they are being implemented in various programming languages. Arrays and strings work very differently in Java as they do in C/C++. This article presents an unbiased comparison between Arrays and Strings.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: one way to pair program when writing code is having one person drive and other navigate which means one writes the code while the other speaks out the code

Researched answer: The classic metaphor in pair programming is the driver and navigator. The driver is at the wheel, the navigator looks at the map; the driver types, the navigator describes the problem and solution

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: In Javascript, functions can be assigned to variables in the same way that strings or arrays can. They can be passed into other functions as parameters or returned from them as well. A “higher-order function” is a function that accepts functions as parameters and/or returns a function.

2. Jest: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly. Jest is well-documented, requires little configuration and can be extended to match your requirements.

3. Objects: In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type.

4. Method: In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type.

5. Classes: Classes are a template for creating objects
